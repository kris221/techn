				<b><p id="blog_heading">Introduction to basic electronics</p></b>
				<p>Whether you are a total non-techie, a new electronics maker, a software developer, or some other type of engineer, you will find this article helpful. I won’t be going into depth on any particular subtopic, but instead I’ll give you an overview of basic electronic principles.</p>
				<b><p id="blog_heading">Voltage / Current / Power</p></b>
				<p>It all starts with voltage and current. The most common analogy for understanding voltage and current is water flowing from an elevated tank down through a pipe.

				Voltage is represented by water pressure which is determined by the height of the water tank. The higher the tank, the higher the pressure. However, the arbitrary height of the tank isn’t what matters. Instead, what matters is the difference between the tank height and the ground height for the pipes.

				The same is true of electrical voltage which is measured in Volts (V). Voltage is measured as a difference between two points. For example, when you say something is 5 volts that really means 5 volts with respect to ground voltage (which is 0 volts).

				Electrical current, on the other hand, is equivalent to the amount of water flowing through the pipe, and is measured in Amps (A). It takes voltage to do the work in order to create this current flow. The more voltage that is applied the more current will be produced.

				Power is the rate at which work is done and is measured in Watts. There are various equations for calculating electrical power but the easiest one to understand is that power is simply voltage multiplied times current.</p>

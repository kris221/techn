        <p class="para">
            Whether you are a total non-techie, a new electronics maker, a software developer, or some other type of
            engineer, you will find this article helpful. I won’t be going into depth on any particular subtopic, but
            instead I’ll give you an overview of basic electronic principles.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Voltage / Current / Power<h2>
                <p class="para">
                    It all starts with voltage and current. The most common analogy for understanding voltage and
                    current is water flowing from an elevated tank down through a pipe.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Voltage is represented by water pressure which is determined by the height of the water tank. The
                    higher the tank, the higher the pressure. However, the arbitrary height of the tank isn’t what
                    matters. Instead, what matters is the difference between the tank height and the ground height for
                    the pipes.
                </p>

                <p class="para">
                    The same is true of electrical voltage which is measured in Volts (V). Voltage is measured as a
                    difference between two points. For example, when you say something is 5 volts that really means 5
                    volts with respect to ground voltage (which is 0 volts).
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Electrical current, on the other hand, is equivalent to the amount of water flowing through the
                    pipe, and is measured in Amps (A). It takes voltage to do the work in order to create this current
                    flow. The more voltage that is applied the more current will be produced.
                </p>
                <p class="para"> 
                    Power is the rate at which work is done and is measured in Watts. There are various equations for
                    calculating electrical power but the easiest one to understand is that power is simply voltage
                    multiplied times current.
